        <p>Dev Space is an extension for VS Code that was created primarily for snippets for multiple languages for users to use and go faster while coding. But now it goes into themes and keybindings.</p>
        <p>It uses the VS API to make the snippets available in the users' snippets list. I made this extension so that people can code faster and also mostly for myself.
            It felt like it was a good project to do.

                <p>This is the syntax and look for one snippet. There is a scope, a prefix, a body, and a description.
                The scope is which language(s) the snippet will appear in.
                The prefix is the word to type in the editor to get the snippet.
                The body is what the snippet is a shortcut for: the body will appear after typing the prefix.
                The description is what is the snippet</p>
                <p>This snippet makes an if statement for JavaScript when the user types "jsif"</p>
                <p>These snippets are made in a special JSON file called .code-snippets for VS Code</p>
