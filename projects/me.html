        <p>This website was made to hold everything I can do or did: my projects, my experiences, and my skills</p>
        <p>This about me page has multiple interactions for the viewer. It made entirely from scratch, no third parties were used exept for: lax (high-tech animations), Animate.css (animations), and Font Awesome (icons)
            This page is an example of what I can do with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I can make beautiful and smooth websites when I really want it. However, my CSS and JS skills still need a bit more practice to become Very Good.

                <p>This website uses JavaScript to create and add all the cards on the home page. It is less code then writting all the cards on the page one by one.
                    And if I want to add a card, I can just add the information and it will be on the page like that: without having me write the complete card.
                    There is less code to see and search in when making changes.
                </p>
                <p>I used the basic JavaScript method to do this. Using the insertAdjacentElement method, I can add the peice of html code I want into the page.</p>
                <p>The algorithm also creates different parties of all the elements in the array (takers) so that the animations on the page is better and more efficient.</p>
